## ðŸ’½ Installation

Run `npm install`

## ðŸš§ Building

Run `anchor build`

Make sure the program ID declared in the `programs/../src/lib.rs` is the same as the key that's used for deployment. The key will be located in `target/deploy/<progra_name>-keypair.json` file. You can check what the current address is by running `solana address -k target/deploy/<program_name>-keypair.json`.

## âœ¨ Vanity address

If you want a vanity address for the program, you can run `solana-keygen grind --ignore-case --starts-with <desired_prefix>:1` and replace the program keypair with the result.

## ðŸ“Š Testing

Run `anchor test`

## ðŸ”— Deployment

Before deployment, update the `Anchor.toml` file with the following values:

- `[programs:<cluster>] day_mint` - DAY token mint address. This is the token that will be accepted as payment method alternative to SOL.

Run `npm run deploy:<cluster>` to deploy the program.

Run `npm run migrate:<cluster>` to initialize and configure the deployed program.
